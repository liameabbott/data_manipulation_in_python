# Data Manipulation in Python

This repository contains several completed, project-type homework assignments from the Winter 2015 semester of the SI 601 - Data Manipulation course with Professor Yuhang Wang at the University of Michigan.

The focus of the course was using the Python programming language to fetch, parse, manipulate, and analyze data in a variety of different formats. The assignments include fetching data using various web APIs and working with data contained in HTML documents, XML files, JSON files, SQL databases, and other formats.
